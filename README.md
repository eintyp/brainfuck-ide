# brainfuck-ide

This is an attempt to create an IDE for brainfuck development.

Possible features include:
* a text input
* running brainfuck programs
* some settings for less clear aspects of the language (such as cell size in bits, what happens when input end is reached etc)
* an overview of the memory (including decimal, hexadecimal, binary, ascii)
* manual commands
* text editor features like indentation
* a debugger / step-by-step mode
* visual editor
* tool for reusable structures (i.e. add a number and it will create a loop that writes said number into a cell)
* ascii table / converter
* â€¦and probably more I will add later

Yes, the world totally needs this.
